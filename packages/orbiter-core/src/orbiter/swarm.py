"""Swarm: multi-agent orchestration with flow DSL.

A ``Swarm`` groups multiple agents and defines their execution
topology using a simple DSL (``"a >> b >> c"``).  Supports
``mode='workflow'`` (sequential pipeline), ``mode='handoff'``
(agent-driven delegation), and ``mode='team'`` (lead-worker
delegation).

Usage::

    swarm = Swarm(
        agents=[agent_a, agent_b, agent_c],
        flow="a >> b >> c",
    )
    result = await run(swarm, "Hello!")
